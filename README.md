# TaskMind

**Elevator pitch (2 lines):**  
TaskMind is a clean, responsive task-tracker that helps users quickly add, prioritize, and complete daily tasks. It also provides intelligent suggestions based on your recent task history to speed up task entry.

**Tech stack:**  
MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, React, JWT (authentication), Mongoose, Chart.js (dashboard charts), Vercel (frontend) / Render or Heroku (backend), Git/GitHub.

**MVP features (must-have):**
- User signup / login (JWT-based)
- Create / Read / Update / Delete tasks per user
- Smart Suggest: suggests task titles from user's recent entries
- Dashboard: pending vs completed counts + upcoming due tasks
- Deployed demo (frontend + backend)

**Timeline (Day 0 → Day 6):**
- Day 0: Repo, README, wireframe
- Day 1: Backend skeleton + /health route
- Day 2: MongoDB models + Auth (signup/login with JWT)
- Day 3: Task CRUD endpoints + auth middleware
- Day 4: React frontend skeleton + connect to backend
- Day 5: Smart Suggest logic + dashboard charts
- Day 6: Polish + Deploy + README update with live links

**How to run (dev):**
_Backend_: `cd backend` → `npm install` → `npm run dev` (uses nodemon)  
_Frontend_: `cd frontend` → `npm install` → `npm start`
